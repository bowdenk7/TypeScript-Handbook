# Why Should I Try TypeScript?

This is meant to be a very brief overview of TypeScript and why you should give it a shot. 
For a deep-dive on the language, check out the [TypeScript website](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). 

# JavaScript rocks

It really does.
You can write web apps (see [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)), server apps (see [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), and even cross platform mobile apps (see [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/)), all in JavaScript.
The language itself is rapidly evolving to meet the needs of it's developers (thanks [ECMAScript committee!](http://www.ecma-international.org/)).
And surrounding the language is a healthy open source ecosystem sporting an incredible number of high quality, well supported libraries that make application authoring a breeze.

# So what's the catch?
JavaScript does have a few drawbacks. Namely:
* Lack of static typing can prove difficult in large projects
* There isn't robust tooling available for JavaScript and it's libraries
* Browsers aren't quick to support all new language features

# Enter TypeScript
TypeScript is an open source, typed superset of JavaScript that compiles down to human-readable JavaScript.
But what does that mean?
It means that to start writing TypeScript, all you need is your existing JavaScript skills.
It also means you can utilize useful features such as static typing, ES6 classes, and others that haven't been implemented by browsers yet, to enable more scalable application development.
But at the end of the day, your output is still plain old JavaScript. So you can leverage the entire JavaScript ecosystem and execute in any browser and on any platform.

# So how do I get started?
Head on over to the [TypeScript website](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and check out a [quick tutorial](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial), [samples](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Samples), or if you're really hardcore, [the entire language spec](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md). Also, you can visit the [TypeScript playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground) to just play around and see what your JavaScript output might look like. 

If you still can't find what you're looking for (or just want to say hi!), you can always find the TypeScript team on [gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/TypeScript).
